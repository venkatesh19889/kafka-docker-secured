##kafka-docker-secured
====================
This repository, dockerized the getting started tutorial of apacke kafka that can be found (here) [https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart].

The cluster will be secured through the SASL_PLAINTEXT authentication mechanism, producer and consumers can be found inside the tests folder.


##Caveats
================
The username and passwords that are in the config files in the config directory, can not be changed at the run time (while docker run) so 
you will have to build the image anytime you want to change the username or pasword for the kafka broker.
